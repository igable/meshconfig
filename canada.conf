  # There can be one or more 'measurement_archive' blocks. These have a 'read'
  # URL which corresponds to the perfSONAR-speaking MA where test results can
  # be obtained from. The blocks also have a 'write' URL which tells tests
  # where the results can be written to. These 'measurement_archive' blocks
  # apply to all tests, and to all hosts in all sites in this organization,
  # unless they are overridden by 'measurement_archive' blocks at the 'site' or
  # 'host' level.

  # There can be one or more 'site' blocks. Each 'site' block corresponds to a
  # logical site in the organization which may contain one or more hosts.
  # Elements in the 'site' block apply to all the 'host' blocks contained
